I have worked on this project individually, and have not given or received too much help. In particular, I have not gained access to any other students' repositories, files, or code, nor have I given any other students access to mine. I have not used generative AI, including but not limited to chatGPT, unless explicitly authorized for this assignment. I understand that my code will be run through a very effective similarity checker, and that academic honesty violations are taken seriously.
